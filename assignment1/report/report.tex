\section*{Question 1}

The problem can easily be cast to an instance of max-flow.

Given is an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where each edge $(u,v) \in
E$ has a weight $w(u,v)$. We have a set $\{0, ..., 5\} \subset V$ of
sources, and a single sink, $t=19$. To solve the problem as a max-flow
problem, we first have to convert it to the form of a \emph{flow
  network}, i.e. we must ensure that the graph is directed, has no
antiparallel edges, and that there is a single source and sink.

We construct a new graph $G' = (V', E')$ as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Add all vertices $v \in V$ to $V'$.
\item For each edge $(u,v) \in E$, we introduce an extra vertex $v'$
  to $V'$, and edges $(v,u), (u,v'), (v', u)$ to $E'$ with $c(v,u) =
  c(u,v') = c(v', u) = w(u,v)$.
\item Add a single \emph{supersource} $s$ to $V'$ and edges $(s,0),
  (s,1), ..., (s,5)$ to $E'$ with $c(s,0) = c(s, 1) = ... = c(s,5) =
  \infty$.
\end{itemize}

This will yield a valid flow network $G'$. When finding a max-flow
$f^\star$ in this network, we can choose between the
\textsc{Ford-Fulkerson}, running in $O(V |f^\star|)$ time, and
\textsc{Edmonds-Karp}, running in $O(VE^2)$ time. It is evident that
\textsc{Ford-Fulkerson} is only asymptotically more efficient when $VE
< |f^\star|$. In our case, the maximum incoming flow to the sink is
$110$, and hence is an upper bound for $|f^\star|$. For this
particular network, \textsc{Ford-Fulkerson} would therefore be the
most efficient method.


\section*{Question 2}

We simply use the method from Cormen section 29.2 for expressing a
maximum flow problem as a linear program:

\begin{align*}
  \text{maximize} && \sum_{v\in V'} f_{sv} \\
  \text{subject to} && f_{uv} \leq{}& c(u,v) & \text{for each $(u,v) \in E$}, \\
                    && \sum_{v \in V'} f_{vu} ={}& \sum_{v \in V'} f_{uv} & \text{for each $u \in V - \{s, t \}$}, \\
                    && f_{uv} \geq{}& 0 & \text{for each $(u, v) \in E$}.
\end{align*}

where each variable $f_{uv}$ represents the value of $f(u,v)$ in the
resulting flow. Note that we omit incoming edges to the source in the
objective function, as the procedure described in Question 1 ensures
that there are never any incoming edges to the supersource. For each
$(u,v) \not\in E$, we fix the corresponding variable $f_{uv}$ to 0.


\section*{Question 3}

The example graph expressed both as an undirected graph and converted
to a flow network can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:example-graph}. The
linear program for the flow network takes on the following (normal)
form:

\begin{align*}
  \text{maximize}   &&& f_{sw} \\
  \text{subject to} &&& f_{wz} &\leq 60 \\
                    &&& f_{zt} &\leq 60 \\
                    &&& f_{tw} &\leq 60 \\
                    &&& f_{wx} &\leq 30 \\
                    &&& f_{xa} &\leq 30 \\
                    &&& f_{aw} &\leq 30 \\
                    &&& f_{ay} &\leq 50 \\
                    &&& f_{yt} &\leq 50 \\
                    &&& f_{ta} &\leq 50 \\
                    &&& f_{ta} + f_{xa}  - f_{aw} - f_{ay} & \leq 0 \\
                    &&& -f_{ta} - f_{xa}  + f_{aw} + f_{ay} & \leq 0 \\
                    &&& f_{wx} - f_{xa} &\leq 0 \\
                    &&& -f_{wx} + f_{xa} &\leq 0 \\
                    &&& f_{ay} - f_{yt} &\leq 0 \\
                    &&& -f_{ay} + f_{yt} &\leq 0 \\
                    &&& f_{wz} - f_{zt} &\leq 0 \\
                    &&& -f_{wz} + f_{zt} &\leq 0 \\
                    &&& f_{wz} + f_{wx} - f_{tw} - f_{sw} & \leq 0 \\
                    &&& -f_{wz} - f_{wx} + f_{tw} + f_{sw} & \leq 0 \\
                    &&& f_{sw}, f_{wz}, f_{zt}, f_{tw}, f_{wx}, f_{xa}, f_{aw}, f_{ay}, f_{yt}, f_{ta} &\geq 0
\end{align*}

The solution to the above linear program is
$$(f_{sw}, f_{wz}, f_{zt}, f_{tw}, f_{wx}, f_{xa}, f_{aw}, f_{ay}, f_{yt}, f_{ta}) = (90, 60, 60, 0, 30, 30, 0, 30, 30, 0).$$

\section*{Question 4}

Given a formulation of the computer network problem as a flow graph
$G=(V,E)$, we need to find an edge $(u,v) \in E$ for which increasing
the capacity $c(u,v)$ by one will lead to an increase in
$|f^\star|$. Moreover, the edge that is increased must be the edge
with the smallest capacity among all edges which can increase the
maximum flow.

An efficient method for finding such an edge is to first find the
maximum flow $f^\star$, and then compute the residual graph
$G_{f^\star}$, and hence finding the minimum cut $(S,T)$. We then
identify the following set of candidate edges
$$
 C = \left\{ (u,v) \in E : u \in S, v \in T,
\substack{\text{increasing $c(u,v)$ by one yields graph $G'$}
       \\ \text{with an augmenting path in $G'_{f^\star}$}} \right\}.
$$

We then pick the edge $(u,v) \in C$ with the smallest capacity, and
increase its capacity $c(u,v)$ by one. I.e. we define a new graph $G'$
with capacity $c'(a,b) = c(a,b)+1$ when $(a,b) = (u,v)$ and $c'(a,b) =
c(a,b)$ otherwise. Note that the set $C$ may be empty, which means
that there is no such single flow-increasing edge. Finding the max
flow and checking for augmenting paths can both be done in polynomial
time, so we regard this method as efficient.

We claim that if the set $C$ is not empty, the above method will yield
a new graph $G'$ with a max flow ${f^\star}'$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $|{f^\star}'| > |f^\star|$, and that
\item there is no edge $(u',v') \in E$ where $c(u',v') < c(u,v)$ for
  which increasing $c(u',v')$ by one will yield another graph $G''$
  where $|{f^\star}''| > |f^\star|$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
  Showing (1) is a direct consequence of Corollary 26.3. Since we
  chose $(u,v)$ such that increasing $c(u,v)$ would yield an
  augmenting path $p$ in $G'_{f^\star}$, ${f^\star}' = f^\star
  \uparrow f_p$ is a flow in $G'$, with $|{f^\star}'| > |f^\star|$.

  Showing (2) is a proof by contradiction. Assume that there is an
  edge $(u', v') \in E$ with $c(u',v') < c(u,v)$ where defining
  $c''(u', v') = c(u',v')+1$ yields a graph $G''$ with $|{f^\star}''|
  > |f^\star|$. This implies that $G_{f^\star}''$ contains an
  augmenting path $p$ going through $u'$ and $v'$, and specifically
  that there must be paths from $s$ to $u'$ and from $v'$ to $t$ in
  the original residual graph $G_{f^\star}$. Therefore, there cannot
  be a path from $s$ to $v'$ in $G_{f^\star}$, because then we would
  have an augmenting path in $G_{f^\star}$, a contradiction. This
  places $u' \in S$ and $v' \in T$, and hence also $(u', v') \in
  C$. Since we chose $(u,v) \in C$ with the minimum $c(u,v)$, we must
  have $c(u,v) \leq c(u', v')$. This contradicts our assumption that
  $c(u', v') < c(u,v)$, and hence we are done.
\end{proof}
