\section*{Question 1}

% TODO: We probably need to make this more mathy
%       but the intuition should be sound 

Given a graph $G$ a 1-tree bound is defined as follows 

\begin{itemize}
  \item You select a vertex $v_1$ from $G$
  \item Remove all edges incident on $v_1$ from $G$ producing $G'$
  \item Find the minimum spanning tree $T$ of $G'$
  \item Add the two smallest edges $e_1$ and $e_2$ incident on $v_1$ to $T$ producing a 1-tree $T_1$
\end{itemize}

We're asked to show that the 1-tree is a lower bound for TSP; that is,
that the weight of the Hamiltonian tour of G with the lowest weight
is equal to or greater than weight  of $T_1$.

If we assume we have a Hamiltonian tour of $G$ that has has a lower
weight than the $T_1$ then it would require that there exists a
spanning tree of $G'$ that  has a lower wight than $T$; this is
impossible since $T$ is a minimum spanning tree. Here's why: A Hamiltonian
tour of $G$ will also need to be a Hamiltonian path of $G'$. In the best case 
the Hamiltonian path $H$ and the minimum spanning tree $T$ will be the same. Since we're
adding the two edges $e_1, e_2$ with the lowest weight then the only way for
$TSP$ to have a lower weight than $T_1$ would be if the weight of $H$ was smaller 
than $T$; a contradiction.
